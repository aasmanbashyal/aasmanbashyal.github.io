I am a Research Engineer at [Angelswing](https://angelswing.io/en/), where I specialize in developing innovative solutions in artificial intelligence, computer vision, and graphics. My work primarily focuses on advanced **3D Reconstruction** and **Computer Vision** technologies. I have experience working with embedded systems and robotics.

At my core, I am a problem-solver driven by the belief that technology should improve people's lives. I am passionate about researching real-time solutions that combine embedded systems and artificial intelligence. My goal is to develop intelligent systems that make lives easier and more efficient.

I am always eager to connect with others who are interested in collaborative projects or seeking fresh perspectives on technological challenges.
