<div style="text-align: justify;">
Designed and implemented the architecture for a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) capable of editing 3D terrain models. The feature converts selected polygonal 3D surfaces into accurate and visually comprehensible 2D representations. The algorithm is designed to flatten the 3D surface into 2D while preserving its texture information intact. Optimized performance to achieve real-time responsiveness (1â€“3 seconds latency), enhancing user engagement and design versatility.<br><br>
